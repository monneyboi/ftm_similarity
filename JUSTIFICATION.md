1. Explain your choices for preprocessing the entities. Explain how you might improve this, given more time and a greater variety and amount of entities.

- I started of by thinking of using the relations in the FTM data to compare entities, as i think that in real world situations, these will be important. Then my idea was to embed properties, and use some weighted average of these to arrive at a score. After some prompting i ended up creating stories for entities, to get away with using one embedding score and keeping things as simple as possible.

2. Explain your choices for embedding the entities and your choice of vector store. Explain how you might improve this, given more time and a greater variety and amount of entities.

3. Explain _what you would need to know_ in order to turn this product into a service that embeds, stores, and matches millions of entities, and serves these matches RESTfully to other applications. This is your turn to ask questions about requirements, tech stack, and data. Ask the _most important, high-level_ questions (no more than 5) that could help you come up with a specification. Explain why these questions are important, what different answers could mean, but do not actually attempt to write a specification.
